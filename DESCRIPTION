Description: The purpose of this package is to provide functions that allow a user to analyze large data sets 
    in a high throughput way. The functions can be used individually, or "main" functions rui/two_group_rui are 
    provided that structure the individual functions in the correct way. The main functions work by first sorting
    data according to its probability distribution into either normal or nonnormal, and then sorts 
    the normally distributed data by scedasticity. The result is three tiers.
    1. tier1 is data which is normally distributed and homoscedastic.
    2. tier2 is data which is normally distributed and heteroscedastic.
    3. tier3 is data which is not normally distributed.
    Each of the three tiers is then analyzed with the appropriate statistical tests. In the multigroup case,
    tier1 is analyzed with a two way anova followed by a Tukey multi-comparison test. Tier2 is analyzed by a 
    Welch t-test followed by a Dunnett T3 multi-comparison test. Tier3 is analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test 
    followed by a Dunn multi-comparison test. 
    In the two group case, tier1 is analyzed with a Student's t-test. Tier2 is analyzed by a Welch t-test. Tier3 is
    analyzed by a Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney test.
